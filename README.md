<h1 align="center">Milestone Project One - "Driven: Formula One Fan Club"</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://#) - TBU

The purpose of this website is to promote a fictional Formula One fan club called "Driven" which operates across Europe.  The page serves to highlight the benefits of being a member in the club, upcoming club events, and location information about fictional physical club locations.  In addition, the page includes a form where a visitor can apply to become a member in the club, with a choice of membership level.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        ##### As a first time visitor, I want to:
        1. Learn about the Driven Formula One club, and the benefits it offers.
        2. Learn about upcoming events being held by the club.
        3. Learn about where the club operates physical locations throughout Europe and the opening hours of each club.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        ##### As a returning visitor, I want to:
        1.  Sign up for the club using the form in the "Join the Club" page.
        2.  Check for newly posted upcoming club events.
        3.  Check the physical club locations across Europe and opening hours of each club.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The page color scheme is based on dark and light gray tones to give a clean and somewhat spartan design asthetic throughout the site.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font used throughout the site is the Google Font 'Open Sans' which gives a clean and simple font which is easy to read across font sizes.  The goal of selecting this font was to further encourage a clean and simple aesthetic on the site.  Sans-serif serves as the backup to Open Sans if it fails to load.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Hero image utilized across the site presents a dramatic view of a Formula One car with the club name overlayed to engage and excite the visitor about the club.  In addition the landing page uses images of Formula One races in progress to draw the visitor's attention to the key details about the club.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".

4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
